# Project Planning and Initialization

## Project Documents
These are crucial documents for understanding the project. Each file includes the 'why,' 'what,' and 'how' of the project's purpose.

- [Community Orientation Document](https://github.com/dav1dk1m/BlinkBoost/blob/main/InitPlan/01%20-%20Community%20Characteristics%20Orientation.pdf)
- [Technology Configuration Inventory](https://github.com/dav1dk1m/BlinkBoost/blob/main/PlanDesign/02%20-%20Technology%20Configuration%20Inventory.pdf)
- [Business Case](https://github.com/dav1dk1m/BlinkBoost/blob/main/PlanDesign/03%20-%20Business%20Case.pdf)
- [Stakeholder Analysis](https://github.com/dav1dk1m/BlinkBoost/blob/main/PlanDesign/04%20-%20Stakeholder%20Analysis%20.pdf)

- [Project Scope Statement](https://github.com/dav1dk1m/BlinkBoost/blob/main/PlanDesign/06%20-%20Project%20Scope%20Statement.pdf)
- [Project Requirements](https://github.com/dav1dk1m/BlinkBoost/blob/main/PlanDesign/07%20-%20Project%20Requirements.pdf)

## Project Kanban Boards
These are interactive boards used for task management in the project. They help visualize the workflow, prioritize tasks, and track progress, focusing on the 'what,' 'who,' and 'when' of project tasks.

## Prototypes
These are early models or samples of the final product, used for testing and refinement. They help us understand the 'look,' 'feel,' and 'functionality' of what I am building.
